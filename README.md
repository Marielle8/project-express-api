# Express API Project

This project was about building an API in Node using Express, create routes in Express and practice data manipulation in JavaScript - selecting, filtering, and limiting arrays

## The problem

This project dosen't work like it should and my heroku app stopped working before I was finished with the project. I struggled a lot with nodemon in the beginning of this project and got a lot of different error messages. One of them was that the port was already in use so the app crashed while waiting for file changes. I got a lot of help from my team members to solve this problems and I also found some answers at stackOverflow. To get the project running I did a codealong with a teacher from Technigo bootcamp. I couldn't put the time that I wanted into this project but if I could I would have put a lot more effort into it. I would have choosen different data and created more endpoints and make it feel more like my own project.
